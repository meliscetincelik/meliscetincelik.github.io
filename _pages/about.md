Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Cognitive Neuropsychology, Tilburg University. I am interested in the neural correlates of multimodal language development and audiovisual speech processing. Using neuroimaging (EEG) and behavioural methods, I investigate how infants, children and adults process audiovisual speech, and the role of brain maturation.

I obtained my PhD degree at the Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, under the supervision of Dr. Tineke Snijders and Prof. Caroline Rowland. In my PhD dissertation, I examined infants’ neural speech tracking and word segmentation, and the effects of social and visual speech cues, as well as the relationship between individual differences in neural tracking and vocabulary development. Before joining Tilburg University, I also worked at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Utrecht University as a researcher in Dr. Caroline Junge’s research group, and as a lecturer in the same department.
