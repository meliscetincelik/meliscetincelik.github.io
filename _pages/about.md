Welcome! 

I am a PhD student in the [Language Development Department](https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-development/3) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. My PhD project investigates the role of social and audiovisual cues in early language development, particularly speech perception and word learning. 

I use EEG to study whether social cues such as eye gaze and audiovisual speech enhance infants’ neural entrainment to speech, as well as word segmentation. I am also investigating the role of joint attention and sustained attention on infants' early word learning in naturalistic interactions.
